# Documentation for Concepts and Ideas
This doc is unsorted and just a plce to dump a few ideas!

### Space Radio Station
- radio station has up to 4 quests at the same time
- station shows which music package is consumed rn (the music that is playing)
- single note quests (tutorials) are also song quests but it's as super simple song! (They get a mix too)
- the inputs consumption of radio station rotates clockwise after one package was consumed
- add reasons to reuse factory parts (maybe some songs could be subsets from each other)
