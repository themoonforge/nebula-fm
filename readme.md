## About
Nebula FM is losing listeners fast. Across the galaxy, no one is tuning in anymore. Then mysterious sources of resonance are discovered on distant worlds. You are sent to harvest these signals and turn them into the sickest space beats the universe has ever heard. Build production lines, refine raw resonance, and keep the rhythm alive, because the future of intergalactic radio depends on you!
